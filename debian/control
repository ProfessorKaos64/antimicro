Description: Antimicro is a graphical program used to map keyboard keys and mouse controls to a gamepad
 This program is useful for playing PC games using a gamepad that do not have any form of built-in 
 gamepad support. However, you can use this program to control any desktop application with a gamepad; 
 on Linux, this means that your system has to be running an X environment in order to run this program.
 .
 This program is currently supported under various Linux distributions, Windows (Vista and later), and 
 FreeBSD. At the time of writing this, antimicro works in Windows XP but, since Windows XP is no longer 
 supported, running the program in Windows XP will not be officially supported. However, efforts will 
 be made to not intentionally break compatibility with Windows XP.
 .
 Also, FreeBSD support will be minimal for now. I don't use BSD on a daily basis so the main support 
 for FreeBSD is being offered by Anton. He has graciously made a port of antimicro for FreeBSD that you
 can find at the following URL: http://www.freshports.org/x11/antimicro/.
